##variable
# a = 1 ##a is  variable work like a container
# b = 2
# name = "Harsha" #string
# print(a+b)
# print(name)

# #Datatype:
# a = 1#a is a integer
# b = 5.33 # b is a float
# c = "Harsha" # c is a string
# d = False # d is a boolean
# e = None # e is a none type varible


## Rules for defining a variable:

# @harsha = 56 # its not running
#variable start from only alphabet and underscore. and does not contain any void space
#can't start from the any digit
#@does not contain any special character


##Operators in python:
'''
1)Arithmetic Operator:
addition: 2+3=5
substraction:3-2=1
multiplication:2*4=8
division:4/2=2
modulus:10%3=1
floor division:10//3=3
exponential/power:2**3=8

#Example:
a = 7
b = 4
c = a+b
print(c)

2)Assignment Operator:
= : a=5
+=: x += 3.....x = x+3
-=: x -= 2.....x = x-2
*=: x *= 2.....x = x*2
/=: x /= 2.....x = x/2

Example:
a = 4-2# Assign 4-2 in a
print(a)
b = 6
b += 3 #Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
b -= 3 #Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)

3)Comparison Operators:
==....equal to
!=....not equal to
>...greater than
<...less than
>=...greater than or equal to
<=....less than or equal to

Example:
d = 5>4 #print true
d = 5>5 #False
d = 5!=7 #True
d = 5==5 #True
print(d)

4)Logical Operators:
and....both condition true
or.....At least one condition is true
not...reverse result

Example:
e = True or False    #Print True
e = True and False   #print False
e = not True   #print False
print(not(True))        #print False
print(e) 

5)Bitwise Operators:
&...AND
~....NOT
^...XOR
`....`
<<....left shift
>>....right shift

6)Membership Operators
in....present int
not in...not present

7)Identity Operators:
is....same object
is not...Different object

###Type 
'''
a = 31 #class <int>
b = 31.2 #class <float>
c = "Harsha" #class <string>
t = type(a)  #class <int>
print(t)
